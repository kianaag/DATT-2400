This project is an attempt at a music visual interaction design peice. 
While the music is playing users can interact with some of the objects on screen.
The idea was inspired from generative art music videos but I wanted it to be interactive.
Each page displays differnt visuals and then restarts when you hit the end page.
I started the project by creating the starting page which is a moon above water by adding a
circle for the moon and noise for the waves. 
Trying to find code to have a page changing effect was really difficult but I eneded up 
finding one on a reddit page where someone was looking for something similar. 
From there I could work on individual pages to display and add music and images.
I stuck with a black and white theme with grey tones changes throughout. 
A website called fun programming was a place I went back to a lot to get inspiration 
and help with coding needed for certain animations and functions. 
For adding sound and images I watched Daniel Shiffman on Youtube. 
Also watched his videos to understand mouseReleased and keyPressed. 
I chose a generic song with no lyrics from youtube so it would go with every page. 
I wish I could of adding more complex coding but I couldnt get some of my ideas to work
and some coding was messing other parts. 
I also would of added more pages to go through with differnt animations and visuals. 
It found adding the println was really helpful to see the modes and add instructions for 
yourself through coding the project. I never use it but now I can see how it is helpful, 
especially when making bigger projects. 
Im glad the system worked but it could of been more intreseting with differnt concepts 
involved.
